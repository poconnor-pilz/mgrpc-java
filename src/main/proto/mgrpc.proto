//The server status topic will be
//  server/o/sys/status
//The server will send a connected=true message to this when it starts up or when a client sends it a message on
//  server/i/sys/status/prompt
//The server will send a connected=false message to server/o/sys/status when it shuts down normally or when it shuts down
//abnormally via its LWT
//The client status topic will be
//  server/i/sys/status/client/{channelId}
//so that clients can have restrictive policies. But the server will subscribe to
//  server/i/sys/status/#
//The client will send a connected=false message to server/i/sys/status/client/{clientId} when it shuts down normally
//(or when it shuts down abnormally LWT or some kind of watchdog). The server will then release any resources it
// has for {channelId}.
// The Channel will have a waitForServer method which a client can use to determine if a sever is up.
// This will method will subscribe to server/o/sys/status and send a prompt to server/i/sys/status/prompt
